## Next Steps

1. **Optimize macOS Configuration**:
   - Fine-tune Homebrew integration for macOS-specific applications
   - Test Mac App Store integration with real user account
   - Add more macOS-specific system preferences as needed

2. **Refine Feature Modules**:
   - Add browser configurations (Firefox, Chrome)
   - Add terminal emulator configurations
   - Add development environment configurations
   - Add media application configurations

3. **Implement Secret Management**:
