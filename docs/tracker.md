## Feature Module Status

| Module | Linux | macOS | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| git.nix | ✅ | 🟡 | Working on Linux, needs testing on macOS |
| fish.nix | ✅ | 🟡 | Working on Linux, needs testing on macOS |
| vscode.nix | ✅ | 🟡 | Working on Linux, needs testing on macOS |
| fastfetch.nix | ✅ | 🟡 | Working on Linux, needs testing on macOS |
| ssh.nix | ✅ | 🔜 | Working on Linux, not yet configured for macOS |
| docker.nix | ✅ | 🔜 | Working on nuc, not relevant for macOS |
| nfs.nix | ✅ | 🔜 | Working on Linux, equivalent needed for macOS |
| nvidia.nix | ✅ | 🔜 | Working on nuc, not relevant for macOS |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete macOS Integration**:
   - Finish nix-darwin installation
   - Test basic darwin-rebuild switch
   - Configure macOS-specific settings

2. **Test Feature Modules on macOS**:
   - Verify git.nix compatibility
   - Test fish.nix on macOS
   - Configure vscode.nix for macOS
   - Adapt other modules as needed

3. **Add More Feature Modules**:
   - Browser configurations
   - Terminal emulators
   - Development environments
   - Media applications

4. **Implement Secret Management**:
   - Set up sops-nix
   - Configure secure key storage

## Issues and Blockers

- **macOS Homebrew Integration**: Need to determine best approach for managing Homebrew packages alongside Nix
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Some configurations may need conditional logic for different platforms
- **Secret Management**: Need to research best practices for sops-nix integration

## Recent Updates

- **May 2025**: Successfully configured nuc with Docker, NVIDIA, and NFS support
- **May 2025**: Refined user configurations for both paul and admin users
- **May 2025**: Started macOS integration with basic directory structure
