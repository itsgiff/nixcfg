## Next Steps

1. **Complete macOS Integration**:
   - Finish nix-darwin installation
   - Test basic darwin-rebuild switch
   - Configure macOS-specific settings

2. **Test Feature Modules on macOS**:
   - Verify git.nix compatibility
   - Test fish.nix on macOS
   - Configure vscode.nix for macOS
   - Adapt other modules as needed

3. **Add More Feature Modules**:
   - Browser configurations
   - Terminal emulators
   - Development environments
   - Media applications

4. **Implement Secret Management**:
   - Set up sops-nix
   - Configure secure key storage

## Issues and Blockers

- **macOS Homebrew Integration**: Need to determine best approach for managing Homebrew packages alongside Nix
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Some configurations may need conditional logic for different platforms
- **Secret Management**: Need to research best practices for sops-nix integration

## Recent Updates
