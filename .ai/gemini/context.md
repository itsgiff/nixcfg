Project Summary:

    Goal: Create a single, unified Nix configuration managed via Git for two machines: a NixOS ThinkPad (x1) and an Apple Silicon MacBook (macbook).
    Location: The configuration repository will reside at ~/.nixcfg on both machines.
    Core Technologies: Nix Flakes, Home Manager, and nix-darwin are the primary tools.
    Key Features: The configuration aims for feature-based organization, reproducibility via Flakes, user-level management via Home Manager, and includes transitional support for Homebrew/mas on macOS.
    Secrets: sops-nix is the planned (optional) tool for managing secrets.
    Version Control: Git is used, hosted on a private Gitea server at git@gitea:paul/nixcfg.git.

Structure & Workflow:

    Directory Layout: A clear structure is defined with flake.nix at the root, hosts/ for machine-specifics (including a Brewfile for the macbook), users/paul/ for Home Manager configs, and modules/ (especially modules/features/) for shared, reusable code.
    Process: The plan is to initialize the Git repo, migrate the NixOS (x1) configuration first, test, push to Gitea, clone/integrate on macOS (macbook), refactor common settings into modules, and then iterate using Git for synchronization.
    Best Practices: Emphasis is placed on documentation (READMEs), logical organization, cross-platform considerations (isLinux/isDarwin), incremental testing, and frequent, descriptive Git commits (conventional commits).
